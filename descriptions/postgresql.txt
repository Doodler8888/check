[BLUE]   1.It will use the current user of the terminal to create a database.
     So if you use this command and the current user doesn't exist for postgres, 
     it wont work.

[BLUE]   2.Identifiers (like table names, column names, user names, etc.) and 
     keywords don't require quotes unless they conflict with reserved keywords, 
     contain spaces, or use mixed-case/capital letters that you want to preserve.
     In such cases, double quotes (" ") are used.

[BLUE]   3.[RED]ALTER ROLE [END][BLUE]modifies the attributes of an existing role.
     [RED]CREATEDB[END] [BLUE]is an attribute that grants a current user permission
     to create databases and delete its own ones.

[BLUE]   4. I need to specify a database. If i don't do that, the system will try
     connect to a database with the same name. That's why i can connect to the
     console as admin user without specifying a database, postgresql creates
     a database with the same admin name by default.
