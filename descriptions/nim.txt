[GREEN]   - Compile the code:
[RED]     nim c -d:release [END]myprogram.nim [BLUE]|[1]
                         
                         
                         
[GREEN]   - Run the code:
[RED]     nim r [END]myprogram.nim


 
   [BLUE]1.The -d:release flag tells nim to compile in release mode, which applies
     optimizations and omits debugging information. this makes the resulting
     binary faster and smaller.
