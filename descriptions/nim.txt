[GREEN]   - Compile the code:
[RED]     nim c -d:release [END]appname [BLUE]|[1]
                         
                         
                         
[GREEN]   - Run the code:
[RED]     nim r [END]myprogram.nim



[GREEN]   - Compiling for a telegram bot:
[RED]     nim c -d:ssl -r [END]botname.nim [BLUE]|[2]



   [BLUE]1.The [RED]-d:release[END] [BLUE]flag tells nim to compile in release mode, which applies
     optimizations and omits debugging information. this makes the resulting
     binary faster and smaller.
   
   [BLUE]2.The [RED]-d:ssl[END] [BLUE]flag in Nim's compiler options stands for "define symbol". 
     The [RED]-d[END] [BLUE]flag is a way to define conditional compilation symbols, essentially 
     setting a compiler directive that can enable or disable certain features or 
     behaviors in the code.
