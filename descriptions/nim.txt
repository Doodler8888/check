[GREEN]   - Compile the code:
[RED]     nnim c -d:release [BLUE]myprogram.nim [END]|[1]
                         
                         
                         
[GREEN]   - Run the code:
[RED]     nnim r [BLUE]myprogram.nim[END]


 
   1.The -d:release flag tells nim to compile in release mode, which applies
     optimizations and omits debugging information. this makes the resulting
     binary faster and smaller.
